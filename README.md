# My Computer Vision projects Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Coursework and my projects repository! 🖥️👁️

This repository is organized into two main folders:-

### Section 1: 

- **Image Processing:** Exploring fundamental image processing techniques such as filtering, transformations, and edge detection.
- **Feature Extraction:** Diving into feature extraction methods for object recognition and scene understanding.
- **Practical Experimentation:** Practical applications and hands-on for image processiing and feature extraction.


### Section 2: Traffic Monitoring System using Ensemble Meachine Learning
- **Objective:** Develop a trafic monitoring system by creating an ensemble model from the best-performing traditional machine learning models.
- **Steps:**
  - Annotate and preprocess video data
  - Extract features such as color histograms, edges, SIFT, SURF, pixel values.
  - Train and test multiple machine learning models.
  - Evaluate models using metrics like AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 score.
  - Build an ensemble model from the top three models and compare its performance.

## Get Started:
1. 📂 Browse the folders `conv-edge_detect-hough_transform` and `traffic_monitoring_system` to explore the specific topics and projects.
2. 🚀 Clone or fork the repository to experiment with the code.
3. 📊 Check out the plots and tables for model performance.
