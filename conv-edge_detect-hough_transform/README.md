# Computer Vision
## An overview of edge detection, corner detection, sinusoid Hough space, and their Implementation

The note book contains the following :-

Sinusoid Hough Space

1. Plotting the sinusoid waves in a Hough space
2. Convolution; Writing a function that convolves an image with a given convolution filter
3. Edge detection; Writing a function that finds edge intensity and orientation in an image
4. The Hough transform; Writing a function that applies the Hough Transform to an edge magnitude image

Feel free to browse through the code, your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
